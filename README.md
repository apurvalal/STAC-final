## About The Project
<p align="center"><img width=22.5% src="https://github.com/flaregunner/STAC-final/blob/master/STAC/src/assets/img/biglogo.png"></p>

As all of us know that the whole world right now is suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic for a long time and it has been a difficult time for all of us but now things are getting back to normal and in this new normal situation it is important to understand that traveling for the business purpose or any other purpose will also be going to resume therefore keeping that in mind our project introduces a new hotel management website to the frequent travelers to book their favorite hotel and be assured about their safety with respect to this virus. As our website will showcase the percentage of the people affected by the Coronavirus in that particular locality in which the hotel will be chosen by the Traveler, therefore ensuring a balance between staying safe as well as resuming back to normal life.
